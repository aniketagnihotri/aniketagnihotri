### Hey, I'm Aniket.

I'm an agile software engineer with experience engineering and testing software solutions. I have a strong passion for building client-facing solutions from the ground up.

At the moment, I'm a senior at Purdue studying CS, focusing on my passions: software engineering and ML. I spend my spare time developing nifty applications or working on cool, innovative projects related to my passions, all documented on my website and GitHub.
