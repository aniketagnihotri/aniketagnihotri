### Hey, I'm Aniket.

I'm a junior at Purdue studying CS. I have industry experience in software engineering, primarily in full stack development and competitive programming.

I spend my spare time developing applications or working on cool projects related to my passions, all documented on my linked website and here on GitHub!
